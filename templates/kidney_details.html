    <h2><b>
        KIDNEY DISEASE </b></h2><hr>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
     
        <h3>About</h3> <p>
        Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. <br><br>
        Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. <br><br>
        When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. <br><br>
        </p>
        

        <h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Nausea<br><br>Vomiting.<br><br>Fatigue and weakness.<br><br> Muscle twitches and cramps.<br><br></p>
        <h3>Prerequisite</h3>

<p>A person must have his/her report handy to fill the values needed in predicting the disease.<br><br> <br><b>Following Reports/tests are needed :</b><br><br><br>
  <b>Complete Blood count(CBC) test</b> - will provide the value for RBC, WBC, anemia, pus-cells, Coronay artery disease, bacteria<br><br>

  <b>Serum test/Serum electrolytes test</b> - will provide value for albumin, potassium.<br><br>
  <b>Blood sugar test</b> - will provide value for Sugar<br><br>
  <b>blood urea nitrogen test</b> - will provide the value of Blooad urea<br><br>
 
<b>Blood-pressure test</b> - will provide the value of Blood pressure and decide hypertension <br><br>

</p><h3>Factors affecting Kidney-disease</h3>
        <p> <b>Age</b>: displays the age of the individual. <br><br>
          <b>Blood pressure</b>: ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg. <br> high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher. <br> low blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower. <br> <br> Therefore the general range of diastolic BP(which is required) is : <br><br>
          Below 60 = Low<br>
60-90 = Normal<br>
Above 90 = High<br><br>
          <b>Albumin</b>: a simple form of protein that is soluble in water and coagulable by heat, such as that found in egg white, milk, and (in particular) blood serum. <br> <br>General range of albumin is : <br><br>
          Above 4.0 = normal<br>
          Below 4.0 = low<br><br>
          <b>Sugar</b>: Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. <br> It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy. <br><br>
<b>RBC</b>: An RBC count is a blood test that measures how many red blood cells (RBCs) you have.<br> RBCs contain hemoglobin , which carries oxygen.<br> A normal RBC count would be: men – 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microlitre (cells/mcL) women – 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL. <br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
0 = normal <br>
1 = abnormal<br><br>
<b>Pus cell</b>: Pus is a whitish-yellow, yellow, or brown-yellow protein-rich fluid called liquor puris that accumulates at the site of an infection.<br> It consists of a buildup of dead, white blood cells that form when the body's immune system responds to the infection.<br> Normal numbers of pus cells are up to 5 in males and may be up to 10 in females.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
0 = normal <br>
1 = abnormal<br><br>
<b>Pus cell clumps</b>: An infection that leads to the production of pus is called a purulent infection. <br>When pus forms within enclosed spaces in the tissues, it causes abscesses. <br>When it forms on the skin surface, it causes lumps known as pustules or pimples.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = present <br>
0 = not present<br><br>
<b>Bacteria</b>: A large group of single-cell microorganisms. Some cause infections and disease in animals and humans.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = present <br>
0 = not present<br><br>
<b>Blood glucose random</b>: Random blood sugar (RBS) measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate.<br><br>
General range of Blood glucose is : <br><br>
70-130 = normal<br>
less than 70 = low <br>
Above 130 = high<br><br>

<b>Blood Urea</b>: A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of urea in a sample of blood.<br><br>
General range of Blood Urea is : <br><br>
6 - 30 = normal<br>
Below 6 = low<br>
Above 30 = high<br><br>
<b>Serum creatinine</b>: Serum creatinine is a blood test done to determine the amount of creatinine present in the blood.<br><br>
General range of Serum creatinine is : <br><br>
0.5 - 1.2 = normal<br>
Below 1.2 = low<br>
Above 1.2 = high<br><br>
<b>Potassium</b>: A potassium test measures the amount of potassium that is present in a sample of either blood or urine.<br> Potassium is an essential nutrient that is found throughout the body and is necessary for healthy cell activity.<br> Without potassium, the heart and other muscles cannot function.<br><br>
General range of Serum creatinine is : <br><br>
3.7 - 5.2 = normal<br>
Below 3.7 = low<br>
Above 5.2 = high<br><br>
<b>White blood cells count</b>: A WBC count is a blood test to measure the number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the blood.<br> WBCs are also called leukocytes. <br>They help fight infections.<br><br>
General range of White blood cells is : <br><br>
4000 - 11000 = normal<br>
Below 4000 = low<br>
Above 11000 = high<br>
Values may slightly differ as per the diet, lifestyle of person. Also the Wbc for pregnant females will be different.<br><br>
<b>Hypertension</b>: blood pressure that is higher than normal.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = yes <br>
0 = no<br><br>
<b>Diabetes mellitus</b>: Diabetes mellitus (sometimes called "sugar diabetes") is a condition that occurs when the body can't use glucose (a type of sugar) normally. <br>Glucose is the main source of energy for the body's cells.<br> The levels of glucose in the blood are controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is made by the pancreas.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = yes <br>
0 = no<br><br>
<b>Coronary artery disease</b>: A disease in which there is a narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood and oxygen to the heart). <br>Coronary heart disease is usually caused by atherosclerosis (a buildup of fatty material and plaque inside the coronary arteries). <br>The disease may cause chest pain, shortness of breath during exercise, and heart attacks.<br> The risk of coronary heart disease is increased by having a family history of coronary heart disease before age 50, older age, smoking tobacco, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, lack of exercise, and obesity. <br>Also called CAD and coronary artery disease.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = yes <br>
0 = no<br><br>
<b>Pedal edema</b>: Pedal edema is the accumulation of fluid in the feet and lower legs.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = yes <br>
0 = no<br><br>
<b>Anemia</b>: a medical condition in which there are not enough red cells in the blood.<br><br>
Representation : <br> <br>
1 = yes <br>
0 = no<br><br>
